# math-writeups

This repo consists of various PDF write-ups for different math and computer graphics concepts. It is mostly for personal use, but gatekeeping knowledge is cringe so feel free to use it (I'll be happy if any of it helps in any way).

If you're curious on how to apply different concepts presented here practically, there's a complimentary [graphics-demos](https://github.com/Zermil/graphics-demos) showing off most of them.
